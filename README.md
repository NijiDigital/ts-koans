# TypeScript Koans

The goal of this project is to improve skills of TypeScript programmers.

It mainly contains some tests that describe some problems to solve and make assertions to check if the component behaves correctly.

The way it works is very simple, all you have to do is to solve the failing tests.

It works the same way as [js-koans](https://github.com/openhoat/js-koans)

Enjoy!
